# Machine-Learning-Public-Data-Set
Machine Learning projects - using public data set

This repository includes the following projects:
1. bike_rental.ipynb:
   Use public data set, perform data set cleaning, data seta nalysis, and run different
   algorithms to predict the total number of bikes rent, then compare the result.
   Algorithms used includes: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
   More descriptions are in the top cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

2. Housing.ipynb: 
   Use public data set, perform data set cleaning, data set analysis, feature selection,
   and run Linear Regression to predict the house price.
   More descriptions are in the top cell of the Jupyter Notebook.
